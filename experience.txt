                <p>
                    I was in charge of supporting the different kinds of analysis, using specialized equipment. I was present in every stage of analysis from sample preparation to report of results. We assured the correct percentage of metals in the batch. I was in constant communication with the Quality administration team.

                <p>
                    I was in the hot area working with 6TON tower melting furnaces, checking the temperature and composition of the metals in the mix, solving any incoming problem in the production line. I made inventories, reports and graphs of the production. I also made a project involving the implementation of a vortex furnace to process small scrap in order to be processed properly in the plant.
